## About the Plugin

Redirect Manager is a comprehensive WordPress plugin that allows users to create, manage, and analyze URL redirects. Unlike traditional redirection plugins, it fully supports query parameters, enabling advanced redirect handling without modifying `.htaccess` files.

With built-in analytics, users can track redirect hits, export reports in CSV format, and import/export redirects for easier management.
